"In some scenarios emissions continue to rise over the century, while others have reduced emissions."
"""NOAA Space Weather Scales Page Has Changed""."
"Another 2013 study found, contrary to Svensmark's claims, ""no statistically significant correlations between cosmic rays and global albedo or globally averaged cloud height."""
The fast rate of the sea ice melting is resulting in the oceans absorbing and heating up the Arctic.
"The current warming period is expected to last another 50,000 years due to a minimum in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit."
A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent.
"Between 1993 and 2018, thermal expansion of the oceans contributed 42% to sea level rise; the melting of temperate glaciers, 21%; Greenland, 15%; and Antarctica, 8%."
"Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is a trace gas, currently (mid 2018) having a global average concentration of 409 parts per million by volume (or 622 parts per million by mass)."
"The RSS satellite temperature record showed a slight cooling trend, but the UAH satellite temperature record showed a slight warming trend."
"Theoretical advances may consist in setting aside old, incorrect paradigms (e.g., aether theory of light propagation, caloric theory of heat, burning consisting of evolving phlogiston, or astronomical bodies revolving around the Earth) or may be an alternative model that provides answers that are more accurate or that can be more widely applied."
"Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating."
"Feds close 600 weather stations amid criticism they're situated to report warming""."
"The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals."
"Abrupt climate change, tipping points in the climate system: Climate change could result in global, large-scale changes."
Hansen said that NASA was 99% confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation.
Paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago (see oxygen isotope ratio cycle).
"According to the study, the safest and most predictable method of moderating climate change is early action to reduce GHG emissions."
23 March 2015.
"It is likely to be in the range of 2 to 4.5 °C, with a best estimate of about 3 °C."
A study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded that they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.
"The particles reflect and absorb sunlight, less sun rays reach Earth surface layers, thus resulting in cooler water and land surface temperatures, and also less cloud formation, subsequently dampening the development of hurricanes."
"Polar Discovery ""Continued Sea Ice Decline in 2005""."
"In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, as a result of massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco's Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents."
"The percentage of baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as the early stage of a ""huge natural selection event unfolding""."
"Some stratospheric cooling is also predicted from increases in greenhouse gases such as CO 2 and CFCs themselves; however, the ozone-induced cooling appears to be dominant."
"Hansen testified that ""Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming...It is already happening now"" and ""The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now...We already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important."""
"The world's largest potential source of sea level rise is the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, which holds enough ice to raise global sea levels by 53.3 m (175 ft)."
"Notable eruptions in the historical records are the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo which lowered global temperatures by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) for up to three years, and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora causing the Year Without a Summer."
"The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest."
